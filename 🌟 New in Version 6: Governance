This version introduces On-Chain Voting. We have transitioned from a centralized control model to a community-inclusive model where VIP status grants actual power.

Key Features:
VIP-Only Voting: Only users who have contributed more than 10 STX can cast a vote.

Anti-Spam Voting: Each unique principal (wallet) is restricted to one vote per poll.

AppKit Ready: Deeply integrated with Reown/AppKit for real-time UI updates (progress bars, gated buttons).

Dynamic Analytics: Track "Yes" vs "No" counts directly from the blockchain.

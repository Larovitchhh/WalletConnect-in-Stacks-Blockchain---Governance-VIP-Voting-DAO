This contract is optimized for the Reown AppKit ecosystem. Developers can leverage the following flow:

Connection: User connects via WalletConnect/AppKit.

Status Check: The frontend calls get-user-status.

UI Adaptation:

Not VIP? The UI shows a "Tip to Unlock Voting" progress bar.

VIP but hasn't voted? The UI displays active "Vote Yes" and "Vote No" buttons.

Already voted? The UI shows a "Vote Recorded" badge and the live results using get-voting-results.

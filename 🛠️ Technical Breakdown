1. Governance Logic
vote-on-status: A public function that checks for VIP status before recording a boolean vote.

has-voted: A map that ensures the "one-person-one-vote" principle, preventing double-voting.

yes-votes & no-votes: Global counters that track community sentiment.

2. The VIP Tier (The Gatekeeper)
The contract automatically promotes users to the VIP tier once their cumulative tips reach 10,000,000 micro-STX (10 STX). This status is required to access the vote-on-status function.
